        <h2>Julian Alexander's top 3 artists, <em>by genre.</em></h2>
        <p>Julian has spent a <i>stupid</i> amount of time listening to music, and as such, has a solidified opinion on his top 3 genres, and their respective best/most influential artists. He has categorized and attempted to explain his reasoning below.</p>

              <ol>
                <li><em>Frankie Knuckles</em></li>
                <p> Frankie Knuckles is perhaps the proginator of not just the subtype of Techno, but house music as well. It's hard to distinctly draw the line, but Knuckles storied career has been one of the most influential you could find. Djing everywhere from New York, to Detroit, and rubbing shoulders with virtually the entire industry, he has been nothing short of prolific. </p>
                <li><em>Robert Hood/Floorplan</em></li>
                <p>Robert Hood is another early Dj, who has truly had an extremely eclectic mix of influences and music. Starting with "pure" techno, he has since adopted the moniker of <i>Floorplan</i> which is his own combination of old school gospel with electronica.</p>
                <li><em>Larry Heard</em></li>
                <p>Larry Heard is third on this list only because of his less prolific production catalogue, but his inventivesness in the genre can't be denied. Even though he is nearing 30+ years of music production, he is still going strong, with his <i>Outer Acid Ep</i> last year still being critically acclaimed, and a loyal fan base behind him.</p>

              <ol>
                <li><em>Aphex Twin</em></li>
                <p>Aphex Twin is perhaps the biggest "underground" celebrity in the musical community. Everyone from Frank Ocean, to Kanye, to Bjork and Radiohead are humongous fans of this shy and strange artist. A master of confusing his audience, Aphex Twin's music resists genre labels, and instead can fall anywhere in between ambient all the way to noise and EDM. Less of a genre definer, and more of a stereotype busting canister bomb, he will always be at the/or near the top of any list about experimental music.</p>
                <li><em>Death Grips</em></li>
                <p>Death Grips has earned an almost horrifying mainstream media appraisal, and that is most likely exactly what they are after. The music made by this group is undeniably violent and aggressive, but upon closer inspection Death Grips is undeniably sophisticated. Everything from their audio mixing, to the complexity of the beats and melodies, references the fact that Hill, Reid and Morrin are incredibly talented musicians.</p>
                <li><em>Arca</em></li>
                <p>Arca </p>
